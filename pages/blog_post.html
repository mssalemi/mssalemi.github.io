      <article>
        As an person attempting to make a career switch, it was great to find Udacity’s Programs. I am able to get full lecture videos, practice problems, help from peers/teachers, plus career support… what more can I ask for!
        <br><br>
        Here is some more info from the Udacity Website Itself!
        <br>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011">
          “This goal of the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program is to equip learners with the unique skills they need to build and develop responsive websites and applications. The program includes 4 courses and 5 projects. Each project you build will be an opportunity to apply what you’ve learned in the lessons and demonstrate to potential employers that you have practical full-stack development skills.“
